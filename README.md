## About
Hyperslice is a simple link shortener built using Astro, Koa, and SQL. The name comes from the first word in HTTP, and the action of slicing a link! <br><br>
Check it out [here](https://link.cnwy.dev/)

## Purpose
The main purpose of this was mainly just because it was fun. I also wanted to learn a bit more about Koa and SQL. It's definitely not perfect, so be warned!

## Want to use it locally?
1. Clone repo ```git clone git@github.com:kiabq/hyperslice.git```
2. From the project's root directory `npm install` in both the client and the api directories
3. Setup and create sql tables with the schemas provided in api/schemas
4. In both directories, run `npm run dev` to run development previews
